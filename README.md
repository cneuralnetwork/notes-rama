# notes rama
What we tried to build here is a minimalistic and yet modern application. Let me guide you through each of the features

## Features 

### New Note
You can create new notes. We've allowed the users to even apply tags to the notes so that you can categorise the notes for further use later on. We also added the feature to search by name and sort the notes by date as well.

### Themes
We've added both light mode and dark mode for the liking of all our users!

### Formatting 
We have included both code and latex formatting as one might also take educational notes while studying
To use latex, write it between $ $ for inline and $$ $$ for separate line
To use codeblocks, write it between ` ` for inline and ``` ``` for paragraphs

### Summaries
You must have written a long note but you need to give a presentation on it, so we have allowed you to summarise the text so that you can get key insights into the notes written.

### Tech Stack
We went for a simple HTML, CSS and JS stack to build this site

## How to deploy locally

1. ` git clone <repo>`
2. ` cd <repo>`
